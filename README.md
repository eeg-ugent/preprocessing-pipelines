# preprocessing-pipelines

Here we will collect preprocessing pipelines that can be used by other researchers.
Below there will be a very short explanation of each pipeline. More information about each pipeline can be found in the pipeline folder.

If you use one of the pipelines, please update the corresponding Log.

If you build a new pipeline please add it to the repo in its own folder with corresponding README and add the short description to this file.
Please name both the folder and the entry below "Pipeline_#" so that everything is easy to find.

Would you like to contribute or just use one of the scripts but need some help? No problem! Please contact raquel.london@ugent.be
