# preprocessing-pipelines

Here we will collect preprocessing pipelines that can be used by other researchers, either as-is or as the basis for custom development.
Below there will be a short explanation of each pipeline including 1.- a short description  2.- dependencies  3.- status  4.- long description

If you use one of the pipelines, please update the status in this file. If you build a new pipeline please add it to the repo and add points 1-4 to this file.
Please name it "Pipeline_#" so that it is easy to find the corresponding description in this file.
